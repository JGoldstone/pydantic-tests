# Notes on implementing a plug-compatible `Clip.py` replacement

The basic responsibilities of a `Parameter` were fourfold:
```python
from typing import Any

class Parameter:
  """Metadata parameter base class"""

  @staticmethod
  def validate(value) -> bool:
    raise NotImplementedError

  @staticmethod
  def to_json(value: Any) -> Any:
    raise NotImplementedError

  @staticmethod
  def from_json(value: Any) -> Any:
    raise NotImplementedError

  @staticmethod
  def make_json_schema() -> dict:
    raise NotImplementedError
```

## Taking these as requirements, one by one:
```python
from typing import Any

@staticmethod
def validate(value: Any) -> bool
    ...
```

```python
from typing import Any

@staticmethod
def to_json(value: Any) -> Any:
    ...
```

```python
from typing import Any

@staticmethod
def make_json_schema() -> dict:
  ...
```
The Pydantic-generated schema matches what classic `camdkit` does; it does not match what
classic `camdkit`'s generated schema _**says**_ it does, because that generated schema is
inaccurate. Consider this unit test of `camera_make`:

```python
import json
import unittest
from camdkit.model import *


class SchemaAccuracyTestCases(unittest.TestCase):
  def test_camera_make_non_handling(self):
    schema = Clip.make_json_schema()
    static_camera_properties = schema["properties"]["static"]["properties"]["camera"]
    camera_schema = static_camera_properties  # ["make"]
    for parameter in ("activeSensorPhysicalDimensions", "activeSensorResolution",
                      "captureFrameRate", "anamorphicSqueeze",
                      "label", "model", "serialNumber", "firmwareVersion",
                      "fdlLink", "isoSpeed", "shutterAngle"):
      del camera_schema["properties"][parameter]
    print(f"\nand the (trimmed-down) camera schema is:\n\n{json.dumps(camera_schema, indent=2)}")
    clip = Clip()
    self.assertIsNone(clip.camera_make)  # initial value is None, which the schema doesn't allow
    clip.camera_make = "apple"
    self.assertEqual("apple", clip.camera_make)  # reads back OK
    clip.camera_make = None
    self.assertIsNone(clip.camera_make)  # can be reset to None, which the schema doesn't allow
    # these are handed correctly
    for invalid_non_none_value in (0, 1.0, 0 + 2j, ("thomson",), {"vendor": "aaton"}, {"dalsa"}):
      with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
        clip.camera_make = invalid_non_none_value


if __name__ == '__main__':
  unittest.main()

```
and look at its output:
```python
/Users/jgoldstone/.local/share/virtualenvs/ris-osvp-metadata-camdkit-v3gml2-u/bin/python /Applications/PyCharm.app/Contents/plugins/python-ce/helpers/pycharm/_jb_unittest_runner.py --path /usr/local/repos/git/jgoldstone/ris-osvp-metadata-camdkit/src/test/python/parser/test_schema_accuracy.py

Ran 1 test in 0.001s

OK

and the (trimmed-down) camera schema is:

{

  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "make": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 1,
      "maxLength": 1023,
      "description": "Non-blank string naming camera manufacturer"
    }
  }
}

Process finished with exit code 0

```

According to the schema, it should not be possible to have the `camera_make` parameter of an
instance of `Clip` be anything other than a string, but:
- the initial value of the parameter is `None`
- when the parameter _does_ have a valid string value, one can assign `None` to it

So simply put, the currently generated schema is wrong, and the more complex one that
Pydantic generates is the one that _accurately_ describes the classic `camdkit` behavior that
the Pydantic code needs to emulate:


...put image here that shows PyCharm _knows_ that None is an acceptable value...


Largely this is well implemented. The case from unit testing that it can't handle is this:


Parameter containers can be serialized to and deserialized from JSON, and they can generate a schema for the container:
  The `to_json()` method iterates over the `_params` class variable, and builds up content either once as `obj["static"][<section>][<canonical_name>]` or `obj[<section>][<canonical_name>]`. The value of the content is produced by the `to_json()` method of the descriptor for the parameter. When the parameter isn't associated with any section, it's inserted either as `obj["static"][<canonical_name>]` or `obj[<canonical_name>]`. What is finally returned is a JSON dict, not a JSONified string.

  The `from_json()` method takes a JSON dict and recursively loads first the static section, and then (in what looks like an O(n^2) fashion) for each non-static section it iterates through all possible items, and if ... whatever, let's trust it for now.

  The `make_json_schema()` class method starts out with some boilerplate identifying the schema, then basically iterates over all the parameters. There are two outer-level cases: the attribute belongs to a section, or it doesn't.
  - If it does belong to a section, then there are two possibilities: either the attribute is static, or it's regularly sampled. The former go into `schema["properties"]["static"]["properties"][<section>]["properties"][<canonical_name>]` with three elements: the schema for the parameter, the parameter description, and the parameter units; the latter, much the same except for the leading `["properties"]["static"]` levels.
  - If it doesn't belong to a section, the situation is analogous.

  The `make_documentation` class method iterates over all the parameters, making a list of dicts with things such as python name, canonical name, etc. This pulls information out of the docstrings of the parameters and out of the docstrings of the validation method.
  ** We'll need a way to express the constraints when defining BaseModel subclasses; wonder if there's anything on the net that does that automatically for annotations?

Then there's what's needed to make a parameter container iterable. The parameter container relies on the subclass to provide an `__item__()`` method.
  ** two potential issues:
    - because the modification and restoration of the sampling state of all the parameters is wholesale, static parameters will be marked as sampled parameters at the end of iteration.
    - because what's being bashed is the static vs. sampled attribute of the parameters stored in the class, it's almost certainly not thread-safe

- model.py
   - that established camera-and-lens-semantically-significant metadata by subclassing the various Parameter subclasses, and adding four class variables to each: canonical_name, sampling, units and section

ProjectionOffset and DistortionOffset should share code cleanly



### Suppressed warnings
See this for a discussion of why #noexception PyNestedDecorators is used above field decorators:
https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-34368/False-warning-This-decorator-will-not-receive-a-callable-it-may-expect-when-classmethod-is-not-the-last-applied

Note that for some reason our ability to use the compatibility classmethod from_json requires `__init__` argument names to match the aliases we use for validation, which is counterintuitive

### notes from test_model.py
Some incompatibilities seem beyond my ability to eliminate them at this time. In such cases, where the
library could not be changed to make the unit test work, the unit test was adapted to the library's behavior,
or eliminated entirely.

Here is a list of such:
- `test_duration()`
  - `duration` is defined as a strictly positive rational parameter; but the unit test assigns a
    an `int` to it. That works, the `int` is promoted to a `StrictlyPositiveRational`, but once
    it's stored in the clip, it's stored as a 
    `StrictlyPositiveRational` instance -- and when it's read, it's returned as a 
    `StrictlyPositiveRational`, not a `Fraction`. Resolved by testing the accessed newly-set
    value against a `StrictlyPositiveRational`.
- `test_serialize()`
  - the `Dimension` constructor was used for both the spatial and sensel dimensions of the sensor.
    If someone specifies pixel / sensel resolution with floating-point numbers, quite possibly
    that's a bug and we want to catch it. To this end there are now two types of dimensional
    specifications: `PhysicalDimensions` and `SenselDimensions`, and `test_serialize()` has been
    changed to use them.
  - the classic `test_model.py` converted the test `Clip` instance to JSON with `clip.to_json()`
    even though to_json()   COME BACK TO THIS
  - the tuple of JSON-ized related sample IDs was being compared to the expected sample IDs with
    `self.assertTupleEqual()` but in fact the expected sample IDs were stated as a tuple of lists
    of sample IDs, not a tuple of tuples of sample IDs, which was flagged as a type mismatch. The
    expected sample IDs were kept the same but put into a purely tuple-based structure. A nearly
    identical problem existed with lens distortion JSON dicts and was similarly handled.
  - the duration issue with `Fraction`s and `StrictlyPositiveRational` objects occurs in 
    `test_serialize` as well and is dealt with in the same manner, by changing the expected value
    to be of type `StrictlyPositiveRational`.
  - it also occurs in `test_timing_sample_rate_model()`
- `test_timestamp()`
  - tests required the temporary construction of an invalid `Timestamp` before validating it,
    but Pydantic doesn't allow even temporary construction of invalid objects. Changed to check
    for Pydantic raising an error rather than having the invalid object's validator return `False`.
- `test_timecode_format()`
  Other than the test code, the classic implementation calls a `to_int()` just once, on an instance
  of TimecodeFormat. In the test code, it calls `to_int()` six times, five of which are as a
  `@staticmethod` and one of which calls `to_int()` as an instance. Since the classic implementation
  defines `to_int()` as an instance method, the calls here were changed from (_e.g._):
  ```python
  self.assertEqual(TimecodeFormat.to_int(TimecodeFormat(24)), 24)
  ```
  to
  ```python
  self.assertEqual(TimecodeFormat(24).to_int(), 24)
  ```
- `test_duration()`
  - the same issue as `test_duration()` except instead of promoting an `int`, it is a `Fraction`
    that gets promoted. Same solution: change the expected result to be a `StrictlyPositiveRational`.
- `test_active_sensor_physical_dimensions()`
  - same issue and same solution as `test_serialize()`: use `PhysicalDimensions` as a replacement 
    for the classic `Dimensions`.
- `test_active_sensor_resolution()`
  - same issue and same solution as `test_serialize()`: use `SenselDimensions` as a replacement 
    for the classic `Dimensions`.
- `test_frame_rate`:
  - same issue as `test_duration()`; same solution. 
- `test_f_number`():
  the [Pydantic conversion table[(https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/conversion_table/#__tabbed_1_4)]
  suggests that a Field that is defined as a tuple should fail validation when a list is assigned
  to it. It does not fail. Test commented out for the moment.  COME BACK TO THIS
- `test_t_number()`: same as `test_f_number()` above.
- `test_transforms_model`: same as `test_f_number()` above.
- `test_timing_mode_enum()`: same as `test_f_number` above.
- `test_focus_position()`: Pydantic is promoting a Fraction to a float even though the Field is
  defined with `strict=True`. COME BACK TO THIS
- ` test_synchronization()`: This final test:
  ```python
      sync.ptp.master = "ab:CD:eF:23:45:67"
      clip.timing_synchronization = (sync, )
  ```
  required the construction of an invalid master (only lower-case hex digits are permitted),
  so the assignment couldn't be tested because the value to be assigned couldn't be created.
- `test_timing_mode_enum()`
  - the classic implementation had a TimingModeEnum enum class and a TimingMode parameter. In the
    Pydantic implementation an enum field does it all. The test was changed to fit this pattern
    while still testing the same idea: construction of `TimingMode` objects with valid existing
    TimingCode objects as arguments should work and construction of `TimingMode` objects with 
    invalid objects as arguments should fail (though here, as above in `test_f_number`, the test
    becomes one of verifying an exception is raised at construction time).
- `test_transforms_from_dict()`
  - `CompatibleModel.from_json()` now handles being fed tuples or tuples of tuples or whatever; but
    this test case was handing `Transforms.from_json()` a tuple wrapping a list rather than
    a tuple wrapping a tuple. The test case was changed to wrap a tuple, not a list, and passes.
- `test_lens_distortion_from_dict`
  - same as `test_transforms_from_dict()`

## Remaining issues

### In schema generation move the 'description' property for tuple[Foo, ...] to Foo
In the cut-out from the complete generated classic schema that corresponds to Synchronization,
the description is included. But in the currently-generated schema, the description is at the
level of the `tuple` that contains Synchronization.

We should move the description, if it is at a level where (1) there are only two siblings and
they are named 'anyOf' and 'default', (2) the value of 'default' is None, (3) the type of 'anyOf'
is `list`, (4) the value of the `anyOf` list is 'array' and ''

### creating sequences (perhaps multilevel) from JSON dicts
In classic `camdkit` for anything more complex than POD, the separation between a Parameter and
underlying dataclass allowed one to say (from `test_lens_distortion_to_dict()`)

```python
from camdkit.framework import Distortion
from camdkit.model import LensDistortions

def test_lens_distortion_to_dict(self):
    j = LensDistortions.to_json((Distortion([0.1,0.2,0.3]),))
    self.assertListEqual(j, [{
      "radial": [0.1,0.2,0.3],
    }])
```
In Pydantici `camdkit` this can't be as straightforward: there's no distinction between parameter
and underlying representational class, and the `to_json()` for Distortion's `@classmethod`
(which in classic `camdkit` was a `@staticmethod`, but that's irrelevant here) has no explicit
signal / flag / whatever that would tell it to emit the JSON for tuples of tuples of `Distortion`
objects. Do we need to re-introduce the distinction between parameter and representation?

Maybe not. If some type `Foo` has its `to_json()` method called and instead of getting a `Foo`
it sees a `tuple[Foo, ...]` all the members of which are in fact instances of `Foo`, it should
be able to handle this as such. Now the _nice_ thing to do here would be to make a new
`CompatibleBaseModel` _on the fly_, make the handed-in `tuple[Foo, ...]` an instance of that
class, and then just call that new instance's inherited `BaseModel.model_dump()` method, et
voilà Robert est le frère de ton père (_i.e._ Bob's your uncle).

This comes up in the other direction as well (in `test_lens_distortions_from_dict()`):
```python
from camdkit.framework import Distortion
from camdkit.model import LensDistortions

def test_lens_distortions_from_dict(self):
    r = LensDistortions.from_json(({
      "radial": [0.1,0.2,0.3],
    },))
    self.assertEqual(r,(Distortion([0.1,0.2,0.3]),))
```
and is also seen in `test_transforms_from_dict()` and `test_transforms_to_dict()`.

### assigning an empty tuple to a regular parameter should raise

My guess is that the issue here is we don't want to serialize empty tuples. The question is, do we
forbid having zero-length tuples as values and insist on having these be None if there aren't any
values at all? There are only two parameters where this is enforced: `distortion` and `transforms`.

An argument for allowing empty tuples is that one might be processing a list of them and could remove
the processed item from the tuple as one went. But since tuples are immutable that's actually a pain
in the ass; you have to create a new tuple that doesn't have the one you just removed. If you want to
do this sort of thing you should be using a `dict`, probably.

The test that should raise, but does not, is this from `test_distortion()`:
```python
from camdkit.model import Clip

def test_lens_distortions(self):
    clip = Clip()
    ...
    with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
      clip.lens_distortions = []
```
The relevant code fragment in `framework.py` seems to be this one:
```python
            elif self._params[f].sampling is Sampling.REGULAR:
              if not (isinstance(value, tuple) and all(self._params[f].validate(s) for s in value)):
                raise ValueError
```


This seems like it _should_ be doable and I've just not yet found the right Pydantic syntax; see
[this closed Pydantic issue](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/8981) from last March.

### `Clip` object has no attribute `_values`

This is a round-trip failure in `test_serialize()`. The `__init__()` for `ParameterContainer` sets this
instance variable to a `dict` with value `None` for every `Parameter` in `self._params`, and this
variable is being compared for equality between the original clip and the round-tripped one.

If we knew that comparing two `BaseModel`-based models with `self.assertEqual(m0, m1)` where every
field in `m1` was present in `m0`, every field present in `m0` was present in `m1`, and every field
would return `True` when compared against its counterpart with `assertEqual()` regardless of whether
`assertIs()` returned `True` or `False`, then we could dispense with the `assertDictEqual` and just
use `assertEqual`.

This seems to be true, _cf._ [here](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/discussions/7057)].

On the other hand currently `self.assertEqual(d, d_clip)` fails, and a glance shows that `len(dir(d))`
is 46 whereas `len(dir(d_clip))` is 176. Some work to do there. COME BACK TO THIS

### upper _vs._ lower case in PTP master regular expressiop

The classic implementation accepts only lower-case hex digits. The IEEE 1588:2019 document uses
uppercase in its documentation but doesn't address serialization to character streams. SMPTE ST 2059-2
("SMPTE Profile for Use of IEEE-1588 Precision Time Protocol") doesn't address serialization to
character streams either but 

### everything has to be reviewed to see if it should be _protected or public

### all of the __all__ lists need to be reviewed

### Note that every CompatibleBaseModel must support default construction
(i.e. without any args supplied to __init__()) or introspection will fail 

If we had to let go of type aliases, how many of them are there?
NonBlankUTF8String
UUIDURN
SingleDigitInt
NonNegative8BitInt
NonNegativeInt
NonNegative48BitInt
StrictlyPositiveInt
NonNegativeFloat
StrictlyPositiveFloat
NonNegativeFloat
StrictlyPositiveFloat
NormalizedFloat
UnityOrGreaterFloat

### suggestion: can we rename the unit "meter / degree"
As it is, it looks like some sort of angular velocity thing, a mixed
metric + imperial and distance + angle unit.

More radically allow units to be a list, but that really feels wrong.

Or require that the units of something be a simple string representing
an SI base or derived unit or an imperial counterpart thereof.

## work for a post-merge second pass:

### resolve the serialization alias vs. `__init__` Pydantic issue

# ??? Could this be as simple as changing the mode argument on dump_mode from validation to serialize? ???

Certain fields have "python names" that are capitalCase, because of a bad interaction between the `__init__`
methods required to support classic `camdkit` creation of parameters solely by position, when the underlying
`BaseModel` class really wants them to be created with keywords. If you try and get around this with
```python
from camdkit.compatibility import CompatibleBaseModel


class ImplementationOnlyModel(CompatibleBaseModel):
    solid: str | None = None
    not_solid: str | None = None

    def __init__(self, solid: str, not_solid: str):
        super(ImplementationOnlyModel, self).__init__(solid=solid, not_solid=not_solid)
```
that works great, but if it's part of the API, that is, it's modeling a parameter, then
that "not_solid" has to be serialized into JSON as capitalCase "notSolid". But if you try
```python
from typing import Annotated
from pydantic import Field
from camdkit.compatibility import CompatibleBaseModel


class APILevelModel(CompatibleBaseModel):
  solid: str
  not_solid: Annotated[str | None, Field(alias="notSolid")

  def __init__(self, solid: str, not_solid: str):
    super(APILevelModel, self).__init__(solid=solid, not_solid=not_solid)
```
this will fail (how?). The workaround is unpleasant as it is a user-visible PEP8-failing wart on the API.
This is that workaround:
```python
from typing import Annotated
from pydantic import Field
from camdkit.compatibility import CompatibleBaseModel


class APILevelModel(CompatibleBaseModel):
  solid: str
  notSolid: Annotated[str | None, Field(alias="notSolid")] = None

  def __init__(self, solid: str, notSolid: str):
    super(APILevelModel, self).__init__(solid=solid, notSolid=notSolid)
```
It is possible that the use of `Field` (and thus `Annotated`) is redundant, given that the field's
true name is now capitalCase `notSolid`.

Anyway, the next step is to dive deeper into Pydantic and ask the community for help. Alternatively,
awkwardly, we require all API users of models with snake_case fields to create those models with
keywords, by not writing any `__init__` for that model class. That's not an option for the initial
PR, though, because backwards compatibility is to be achieved if at all possible, and ... here, it's
definitely possible. Ugly, but possible.

### semi-automatically generate the constraints string.
As a stopgap, to keep the field definitions in `clip.py` and `_foo__types.py` from getting unreasonably bloated,
and to avoid the risk that the Pydantic docstring extractor could get confused (probably not but I'm not in the
mood to push things), the really generic constraints are all isolated over in `compatibility.py` and are
imported one by one into the various `_foo__types.py` modules.

And the ones that are very parameter-specific are in the json_schema_extra data, making field definitions
even uglier. Easy to see how they work, but wow, ugly. Hopefully not confusing Pydantic in its docstring
extraction.

But as it stands, there's a tiny bit of inconsistency in the wording and the punctuation across
compatibility descriptions.

Note that at the moment, the constraints for the REGULAR items are incorrect, except for Distortion and Undistortion.
Only those two REGULAR parameters refer to a list of things.
The generation would have to be recursive and could have levels of verbosity:
- "The parameter must be a string with more than zero and fewer than 1024 characters"
- "The parameter must be a tuple of valid Timecode instances"
- "The parameter must be a valid PhysicalDimensions instance"
- ""The parameter must be a PhysicalDimensions instance with
  width greater than 0, and
  height greater than 0
  """
And of course it would get really, really deep for Synchronization.

### fix the constraints for regular types

Many of these (_cf._ `tracker_notes`) only describe the contained type `Foo` and don't mention the `tuple[_Foo_]`
container. Of course the real way to fix this is, as discussed above, to automatically generate the constraints.

### fix various typos and omissions

In the validation message for strings parameters there's a missing "n" at the end of "betwee"

In the docstring for lens_custom it's "additonal" where it should be "additional"

The presence or absence of "additionalProperties": False in generated JSON schemas seems...irregular 

The model name in Distortion can be of infinite length

### questionable

Why does lens distortion uniquely require at least one element in a clip?

Why is the f-number of the lens constrained to be greater than OR EQUAL TO zero, rather than greater than 0?
Same question for tStop focusDistance focalLength

WHy does lens_custom have a units:None when other things without units do not?
